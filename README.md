# Vinclicker
Some time ago, I had an application on my computer capable of automating mouse and keyboard presses. After some occasional usage and my switching computers 2-3 times however, the app had seemingly vanished from not just my device but the internet as a whole.
After some time I'd come to the realization that being a beginner programmer, I could make my own autoclicker to suit my own needs, and this is what came of it. 

That said, I only intend to showcase it on here since it's more for personal use (and I don't care to figure out Windows' digital certificates to make it not show up as a trojan horse for people that may download it. Unless there's demand for that sort of thing.)

With that said, this project is therefore dedicated to that vanished application, and whoever was responsible for it.

## What Can Vinclicker Do?
As of writing this, Vinclicker's features include:
- The ability to automate mouse or keyboard button presses
  - Left and Right click automation
    - In addition, a setting for "freezing" the mouse cursor's position for every click
  - Keyboard key automation (all alphanumeric characters)
- The ability to set the interval at which your button of choice will be clicked
  - This being on a per-minute, second, and millisecond basis
- The ability to set, and later use, a hotkey to toggle clicking on and off
- Color schemes for the app (preset and custom)
- Saving all of the above settings as they are applied for later use
